# The hash symbol starts a comment
# Programs contain comments to explain the code to other people
# They don't actually do anything

# The print statement writes out a string to the user
print("Hello, this is a simple program")

# Strings are bits of text surrounded by single ' or double quotes ".

# You can store a string in a variable, here 'information' is the name of the variable
information = 'A string stored in a variable'

# This is called 'assigning a value' to a variable

# Here we are printing the contents of the variable
print(information)

# The input statement prompts the user for some input
name = input("What is your name? ")

# You can use the '+' symbol to add strings.
# This is calles concatenation
message = "Welcome "+name+"!"
print(message)

# Now, try it out yourself! 
# Remember to use the print statement to see what the value of a variable is.
# 
# 1) Create your own string variables and assign a value to them.
#
# 2) What happens when you assign a different value that you have already used?
# 
# 3) Try using the same variable mutliple times when adding strings with +
#
# 4) What happens when you mutliply a string with a number like this
#    "a rose is"*5
# 
# 5) Does the result of the last task look good? How can you make it more readable?
# 
# 6) Ask the user for a word and then print a message where the word is repeated three times.
#
# 7) Just like in maths, you can combine operators * and + with brackets ()
#    Try something like 
#    (message + " ")*3
